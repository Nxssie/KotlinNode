Each task needs:

* Title (Varchar(30))
* Description (Varchar(255))
* Done (Boolean / Tinyint(1))

### Installing :gear:

Open a command line console and clone this project.

```
git clone https://github.com/Nxssie/KotlinNode
```

Go to the new created directory. After that go to the backend directory and install all dependencies:

```
cd KotlinNode
cd backend
npm install
```

After that start your MySQL Server and import the database [db_tasks.sql](https://github.com/Nxssie/KotlinNode/blob/master/backend/db_tasks.sql) included in the /backend directory of this project.

Start the backend project

```
node server.js
```

And finally start the frontend Android App with Android Studio (ver. 4.1).

## DevNotes :memo:

There are some methods in the backend as findAllUndone, findAllDone or deleteAll that are not implemented in the frontend. My main idea was implementing them but didn't found a way to do it so, if you wanna help you could do a pull request with some code and if it works adapting this functions to the frontend UI correctly I will approve it. Thanks for all one more time :heart:
